# Twitter-Scraping

Install necessary packages:

Install "snscrape" to scrape Twitter data.
Install "pandas" to create a DataFrame.
Install "pymongo" to connect with MongoDB.
Install "streamlit" to build a web app.
Create a function to scrape Twitter data using "snscrape" library:

Use the "snscrape" library to scrape data based on the input keyword or hashtag, start date, and end date.
Retrieve the necessary data fields such as date, ID, URL, tweet content, user, reply count, retweet count, language, source, and like count.
Create a list of dictionaries to store the scraped data.
Create a function to store the scraped data in MongoDB:

Connect to MongoDB using "pymongo".
Create a new collection or use an existing collection to store the scraped data.
Insert the list of dictionaries into the collection along with the keyword or hashtag used to scrape the data and the date on which the data was scraped.
Build a Streamlit app:

Create a web page using "streamlit" to allow the user to input the keyword or hashtag to be searched, select the date range, and limit the tweet count to be scraped.
Create a button to initiate the scraping process and display the scraped data in a table format.
Create a button to upload the scraped data into MongoDB.
Create a button to download the scraped data in CSV and JSON formats.
Deploy the app:

Deploy the Streamlit app on a web server or cloud platform.
By following these steps, you can create a solution to scrape Twitter data, store it in MongoDB, and build a web app using Streamlit to interact with the scraped data.
